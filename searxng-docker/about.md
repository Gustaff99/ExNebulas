# About exNebulas

exNebulas is a [metasearch engine], aggregating the results of other
{{link('search engines', 'preferences')}} while not storing information about
its users.

The exNebulas project is a browser based in an open source proyect called Searxng, driven by an open community, you can get more information joining them on Matrix if you have questions or just want to chat about Searxng at [#exNebulas:matrix.org]

## Why use it?

- exNebulas may not offer you as personalized results as Google, but it doesn't
  generate a profile about you.
- exNebulas doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a
  third-party, and it can't be used to compromise you.
- exNebulas is free software, the code is 100% open, and everyone is welcome to
  make it better.

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe
in digital freedom, make exNebulas your default search engine or run it on your
own server!

## How do I set it as the default search engine?

exNebulas supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

- [Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link, you will also find some useful instructions
  for Chrome and Safari.
- [Chromium]-based browsers only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.

When adding a search engine, there must be no duplicates with the same name.  If
you encounter a problem where you cannot add the search engine, you can either:

- remove the duplicate (default name: exNebulas) or
- contact the owner to give the instance a different name than the default.

## How does it work?

exNebulas is a fork from the well-known [searx] [metasearch engine] which was
inspired by the [Seeks project].  It provides basic privacy by mixing your
queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data.  exNebulas
can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the
default search engine.

The {{link('stats page', 'stats')}} contains some useful anonymous usage
statistics about the engines used.
